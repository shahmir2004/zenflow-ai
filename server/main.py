"""ZenFlow AI — yoga form-check API.

A single WebSocket answering one question per frame: is the body in the
selected pose right now, how long has it been held, and what should be fixed.

This is the yoga half of ``shahmir2004/exercise-form-correction``, extracted so
the app can be deployed on its own. The exercise pipeline — HMM/k-NN movement
classification, rep counting, chunked video upload — is not here, and neither
are its dependencies. See ``docs/YOGA_API.md``.

No video ever reaches this server. Clients run MediaPipe in the browser and
send 33 landmark coordinates per frame; everything here is geometry and timing.
