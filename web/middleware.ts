 * signed-in user would silently become signed-out on their next navigation.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT gate any route. ZenFlow is guest-first: the whole
 * live session works signed out, and the landing page promises exactly that
 * ("no account needed for your first flow"). Pages that need a user check for
 * one themselves and offer sign-in; nothing redirects at the edge.
